How to remove old kernels in Fedora 22/23 (self.linux4noobs)

submitted 1 year ago * by Simmo3D

Hey everyone. Im just wondering how to remove the old 4.2.0 kernel in Fedora 23 as my system has 4.2.1 running. Also, after removing an old kernel, how can I stop it from still being displayed at boot? Its always pre-highlighting the 4.2.0 kernel and I have to manually select 4.2.1 to boot.

Is it as simple as: dnf remove kernel-4.2.0-300.f23.x86_64

Followed by

sudo update-grub ?
